                <p>Hey, it's Emmy Agama — the guy who's crashed businesses twice and rebuilt to consistent ₦2M+ months. This challenge is the exact system I wish I had when I was stuck at ₦500k/month wondering why nothing was moving.</p>
                <p>If you're a Nigerian business owner consistently making ₦300,000 – ₦800,000 per month…<br>but you know deep down you should be hitting ₦1 million+… and you're tired of working harder with no real breakthrough…</p>
                <h1>Scale Your Business to ₦1 Million Per Month in Just 30 Days<br>— And Win Your Money Back If You Do.</h1>
                <p>The proven, battle-tested system that took me from multiple business crashes to consistent ₦2M+ months — now distilled into a 30-day challenge for serious owners ready to lock in their 2026 breakthrough.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The hidden “profit leak” quietly stealing ₦300k+ from 90% of ₦500k/month businesses every single month…</li>
                    <li>Why pouring more money into ads is the fastest way to stay stuck (and the little-known 72-hour traffic fix that costs nothing)…</li>
                    <li>The exact 3-step closing sequence my clients use to turn “maybe” leads into high-ticket sales without sounding salesy…</li>
                    <li>How to build an “owner-exit” system so your business makes money even when you’re on vacation (the secret most ₦700k owners never discover)…</li>
                    <li>The one diagnosis mistake that keeps good businesses plateaued for years — and how to fix it in Week 1…</li>
                    <li>Why “hustle harder” is killing your growth (and the leverage shift that added ₦800k/month for three of my clients)…</li>
                    <li>The little-known reason most Nigerian businesses crash after their first big win — and how to make sure yours never does again…</li>
                </ul>

            <img src="https://emmyagama.github.io/one-million/images/revenue%20plateau.webp" alt="Revenue Plateau to Breakthrough Graph">
            <p>Sound familiar?</p>
            <p>I’ve watched a ₦1.5M/month business crumble to ₦200k. I’ve built a ₦2M/month business that crashed to zero. I know exactly why you’re stuck — and more importantly, I know the exact system to get you unstuck, for good.</p>
            <p>My name is Emmy Agama, and I don’t teach theory. I teach the repeatable, systemized survival blueprint I had to learn the hard way.</p>
            <p>At 12 years old, I watched my mother’s business bring in ₦1.5 million every single month. By the time I was 16, that same business was barely scraping ₦200k. Life got busy. Chaos took over. The "magic" that built it couldn’t be replicated. There was no system — so when she couldn’t be everywhere at once, the business bled out.</p>
            <p>I thought I was smarter. I started failing at 12, 17, 18… until at 19 I broke through to ₦400k/month, and by 20 I was at ₦2 million monthly. I felt unstoppable.</p>
            <p>Then in 2021, it all crashed again — same pattern. Life intervened, the hustle couldn’t sustain, and I was back to zero.</p>
            <p>That’s when I got serious. I joined a top-tier consulting firm and surrounded myself with people who build scalable, owner-independent businesses.</p>
            <p>My team and I have since worked directly with hundreds Nigerian business owners who were exactly where you are: stuck at ₦200k–₦800k, knowing they’re capable of more, but hitting the same invisible wall every month.</p>
            <p>Our job? Find the single biggest leak, implement the precise fix, and install the operating system so the growth becomes the new normal — not just a lucky spike.</p>
            <p>If the plateau feels comfortable but is slowly killing your freedom, your family time, and your bigger vision… keep reading.</p>
            <p>You’re not lazy. You’re not unlucky. You just don’t have the full system yet.</p>
            <h2>That’s why I created the ₦1M/Month 30-Day Challenge</h2>
            <p>It’s the exact protocol we use with private clients to rapidly diagnose leaks, flood the business with ideal buyers, convert at higher prices, and systemize for owner freedom — so you hit ₦1 million months that last.</p>
            <p>Here’s what becoming a ₦1M/month business owner will do for you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Finally break free from the monthly revenue rollercoaster and enjoy predictable, growing income</li>
                <li>Buy back your time — run your business instead of it running you</li>
                <li>Provide the lifestyle, family security, and freedom you started this for</li>
                <li>Start 2026 with momentum, confidence, and a clear path to ₦2M–₦5M</li>
                <li>End the exhaustion of working harder with no proportional reward</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>"I was 'comfortably stuck' at ₦450k for 9 months. I tried everything — more ads, new logos, even a website. Nothing moved the needle. After the Challenge, we identified my real problem: I was selling to everyone and converting no one. We fixed my messaging in Week 2. By Week 4, I had a waitlist. Last month, I did ₦1.3M. It wasn't about working harder. It was about finally working on the right thing."</p>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>"My business was me. If I slept, revenue stopped. I hit ₦700k once but was working 18-hour days. I joined the Challenge to buy my time back. The scaling systems in Week 3 changed everything. I created two simple SOPs and hired my first virtual assistant. Now my business runs without me micromanaging every detail. Last month, I hit ₦1.1M while on a 5-day vacation. That was the real win."</p>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>"After a great start, my revenue was sliding backward from nearly ₦800k down to ₦300k. I was desperate. The audit in Week 1 showed me I was bleeding cash from two bad client contracts and inefficient ad spend. We plugged the leaks immediately and reallocated my budget. 30 days later, I was back at ₦950k and climbing with a clear, profitable plan. This didn't just save my business; it gave me my confidence back."</p>
